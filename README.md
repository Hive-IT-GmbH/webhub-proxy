# HÃ¼ttig & Rompf - WebHub Proxy

This script can be installed on your webserver to proxy all requests to the Huettig and Rompf Webhub trough your own server.
What that means is, that there is absolutely no privacy related data (like your users ip address) sent to Huettig and Rompf servers.
Therefore, you are safe to use the snippets/calculators without additional "opt-in" feature for GDPR.
